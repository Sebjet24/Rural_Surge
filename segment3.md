* Selected topic
Rural Surge: A Study of Internet Quality & Availability in Kansas

Reason topic was selected
For small rural counties in Kansas, the 2020 pandemic emphasized a lack of quality internet access. Schools were closed, and emergency remote instruction became the method to address educational delivery moving into fall 2020. However, as students, parents and teachers attempted to learn and work from home, it became clear that not all internet is created equal. Many community members had only cellular data service with only a hotspot connected to a notebook or just a cell phone, which made participating in an online learning environment impossible. Those who had internet access experienced slow download rates that made it difficult to participate in online class activities.

Our group decided to dive into this topic, and research internet availability and quality in the state of Kansas.

## GitHub Repository (10 points)

### Main Branch
All code in the main branch is production-ready. All code is clean, commented, easy to read, and adheres to a coding standard (e.g., PEP8)

The main branch should include:

* All code necessary to perform exploratory analysis
* Most code necessary to complete the machine learning portion of the project

### README.md
The README.md should include:

* Description of the communication protocols has been removed
* Cohesive, structured outline of the project (this may include images, but they should be easy to follow and digest)
* Link to Google Slides draft presentation

### Individual Branches
Requirements for the individual branches follow:

At least one branch for each team member
Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the third segment (12 total commits per person)

## Machine Learning Model (45 points)
Students will be expected to submit the working code for their machine learning model, as well as the following:

Description of data preprocessing
Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including the decision-making process
Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables)
Description of how they have trained the model thus far, and any additional training that will take place
Description of current accuracy score

Additionally, the model obviously addresses the question or problem the team is solving.

## Database Integration (0 points)
There are no deliverables for the database integration section of the project for this segment.


## Dashboard (30 points)
The dashboard presents a data story that is logical and easy to follow for someone unfamiliar with the topic. It includes the following:

* Images from the initial analysis
* Data (images or report) from the machine learning task
* At least one interactive element
