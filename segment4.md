## Presentation (25 points)
### Content
The presentation tells a cohesive story about the project and includes the following:

* Selected topic

* Reason the topic is selected

* Description of the source of data

* Questions the team hopes to answer with the data

* Description of the data exploration phase of the project

* Description of the analysis phase of the project

* Technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms used throughout the project

* Result of the analysis

* Recommendation for future analysis

* Anything the team would have done differently

## Slides
Presentations are finalized in Google Slides and should include:

* Slides are primarily images or graphics (rather than primarily text).

* Images are clear, in high-definition, and directly illustrative of subject matter.

## Live Presentation
The team members deliver the presentation in equal proportions. The live presentation should include the following:

* Demonstrates the interactivity of the dashboard in real time

* Adheres to the time limits provided by instructor

* Includes speaker notes, flashcards, or a video of the presentation rehearsal

## GitHub Repository (10 points)

### Main Branch
All code in the main branch is production-ready. All code is clean, commented, easy to read, and adheres to a coding standard (e.g., PEP8)

The main branch should include:

* All code necessary to perform exploratory analysis

* All code necessary to complete machine learning portion of project

* Any images that have been created (at least three)

* Requirements.txt file

### README.md
The README.md should include:
* Cohesive, structured outline of the project (this may include images, but they should be easy to follow and digest)
* Link to dashboard (or link to video of dashboard demonstration)
* Link to Google Slides presentation

### Individual Branches
Requirements for the individual branches follow:

* At least one branch for each team member
* Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the final segment (16 total commits per person)
* Link to Google Slides draft presentation

## Machine Learning Model (25 points)
Students will be expected to submit the working code for their machine learning model, as well as the following:

* Description of data preprocessing
* Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including the decision-making process
* Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
* Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
* Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables)
* Description of how the model was trained (or retrained, if the team is using an existing model)
* Description and explanation of model's confusion matrix, including final accuracy score
* Additionally, the model obviously addresses the question or problem the team is solving.

## Database Integration (25 points)
Students will be expected to present a final project with a fully integrated database.

* Database stores static data for use during the project

* Database interfaces with the project in some format (e.g., scraping updates the database)

* Includes at least two tables (or collections, if using MongoDB)

* Includes at least one join using the database language (not including any joins in Pandas)

* Includes at least one connection string (using SQLAlchemy or PyMongo)

IMPORTANT
If you use a SQL database, you must provide your ERD with relationships.

## Dashboard (15 points)
The dashboard presents a data story that is logical and easy to follow for someone unfamiliar with the topic. It includes all of the following:

* Images from the initial analysis
* Data (images or report) from the machine learning task
* At least one interactive element
* Either the dashboard is published or the submission includes a screen capture video of it in action.
