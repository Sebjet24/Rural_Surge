# Rural Surge: A Study of Internet Quality & Availability in Kansas

## Project Team
Sebastian Scholl, Fernando Porras, Mindy Collmeyer, Teresa Wehmeier
  

## Background on our Topic
For small rural counties in Kansas, the 2020 pandemic emphasized a lack of quality internet access. Schools were closed, and emergency remote instruction became the method to address educational delivery moving into fall 2020. However, as students and parents attempted to learn and work from home, it became clear that not all internet is created equal. Many community members had only cellular data service, which made participating in an online learning environment impossible. Those who had internet access experienced low download rates that many were unable to participate in online class activities.

Our group decided to dive into this topic, and research internet availability and quality in the state of Kansas.

## Project Outline

### Our Topic

**Internet Availability & Quality in Kansas**
   - How does internet access support (quality, availability, etc.) compare between rural and urban areas in Kansas?
   - What Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are available in Kansas? 
   - How does their support vary between rural and urban communities?
   - Is there a link between poverty rate and quality internet access?
   - Is there a link between school district success and quality internet access?

### Our Research

**Where is our data coming from?**
   - [State Library of Kansas](https://kslib.info/423/State-Data-Center)
     * Kansas info: County data, Lat/long, County population, Poverty by county, School district info
   - [FCC Fixed Broadband Deployment](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/#/data-download)
     * Internet Providers and speeds correlated with location
   - [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural/2010-urban-rural.html)
     * Population density



### Machine Learning Modeling

- Description of preliminary data preprocessing

   * Store csv files on GitHub
   * Create a [Schema](https://github.com/Sebjet24/Rural_Surge/blob/Mindy/Resources/schema.sql) to show how we organized the data
   * Create ERDs (Entity Relationship Diagrams)
    
     **ERD - FCC data**

     **ERD - State of Kansas data**
     
      <img src="Images/ERD-Kansas_Tables.png" width="50%" height="30%">
      
   
   * Load data into a database in AWS
   * Connect database from AWS into pgAdmin
   * Discuss what data we need for our Dataset
   * Process (format, clean and sample) our data using PySpark
   * Develop usable DataFrames through Jupyter Notebook and return DataFrames as CSV files

- Description of preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including their decision-making process

  * Rural and urban % per KS county
  * Number of ISP options per KS county
  * Highest internet speed per KS county

- Description of how data was split into training and testing sets

  * TBD

- Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
  
  * The team discussed the different machine learning options, and initially thought that a **Decision Tree** would be a good fit for our project.

- After learning more about the data, we decided that an **Unsupervised Learning** model would be a better fit. 

  * Using the K-means clustering algorithm, we could demonstrate how population density in each Kansas county correlated with internet speed, as well as number of Internet Service Providers
