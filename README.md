# Rural Surge: A Study of Internet Quality & Availability in Kansas

### Project Team
Sebastian Scholl, Fernando Porras, Mindy Collmeyer, Teresa Wehmeier


### Background on our Topic
For small rural counties in Kansas, the 2020 pandemic emphasized a lack of quality internet access. Schools were closed, and emergency remote instruction became the method to address educational delivery moving into fall 2020. However, as students and parents attempted to learn and work from home, it became clear that not all internet is created equal. Many community members had only cellular data service, which made participating in an online learning environment impossible. Those who had internet access experienced low download rates that many were unable to participate in online class activities.

Our group decided to dive into this topic, and research internet availability and quality in the state of Kansas.

### Source of our Data
- State Library of Kansas (https://kslib.info/423/State-Data-Center)
- FCC Fixed Broadband Deployment (https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/#/data-download)
- US Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural/2010-urban-rural.html)

### Questions we hope to answer with the data
- How does internet access support (quality, availability, etc) compare between rural and urban areas in Kansas?
- What Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are available in Kansas? How does their support vary between rural and urban communities?


### Communication Protocols
- Group Slack channel
- Group Project GitHub, including a branch for each team member
- Breakout room during class time
- Saturday Zoom calls (March 19th and 26th)
- Team has shared phone numbers and email addresses
