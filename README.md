# Rural Surge: A Study of Internet Quality & Availability in Kansas

## Project Team
Sebastian Scholl, Fernando Porras, Mindy Collmeyer, Teresa Wehmeier
  

## Background on our Topic
For small rural counties in Kansas, the 2020 pandemic emphasized a lack of quality internet access. Schools were closed, and emergency remote instruction became the method to address educational delivery moving into fall 2020. However, as students and parents attempted to learn and work from home, it became clear that not all internet is created equal. Many community members had only cellular data service, which made participating in an online learning environment impossible. Those who had internet access experienced low download rates that many were unable to participate in online class activities.

Our group decided to dive into this topic, and research internet availability and quality in the state of Kansas.

## Project Outline

### Our Topic

**Internet Availability & Quality in Kansas**
   - How does internet access support (quality, availability, etc.) compare between rural and urban areas in Kansas?
   - What Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are available in Kansas? 
   - How does their support vary between rural and urban communities?
   - Is there a link between poverty rate and quality internet access?
   - Is there a link between school district success and quality internet access?


### Our Project Plan

### Our Research

**Where is our data coming from?**
   - [State Library of Kansas](https://kslib.info/423/State-Data-Center)
     * The Kansas State Library has extensive data for all counties in the state.
     * We plan to use this data as a layer in the interactive map and as a feature in the machine learning model.
     * Kansas info: County data, Lat/long, County population, Poverty by county, School district info
     
   - [FCC Fixed Broadband Deployment](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/#/data-download)
     * The FCC tracks broadband access across the United States, which includes an interactive map and the data tables behind the map. 
     * We used an Area table and Provider table to collect data about Internet Providers and speeds correlated with location

   - [United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)](https://www.usda.gov/reconnect)
     * The USDA provides grants and loans to improve internet infrastructure across the nation. 
     * Through this website, we found useful links to datasets from the US Census Bureau.
    
   - [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural/2010-urban-rural.html)
     * We struggled to find data relevant to our project until we stumbled onto a link to the data from the [USDA ReConnect site](https://www.usda.gov/reconnect).
     * This data was used to obtain the rural and urban density and population percentages by county. 
     * This data is used in the machine learning model, and will be a layer in the interactive map.
   

### Machine Learning Modeling

- Description of preliminary data preprocessing & database development

   * Store csv files on GitHub
   * Create a [Schema](https://github.com/Sebjet24/Rural_Surge/blob/Mindy/Resources/schema.sql) to show how we organized the data
   * Create ERD (Entity Relationship Diagrams)

   * Load data into Amazon S3 bucket

   * Connect database from AWS into pgAdmin

   * Transform data using PySpark
       * Here is an example: https://github.com/Sebjet24/Rural_Surge/blob/main/my_project_20_group_3.ipynb
    
   * Run various queries and create tables to organize the data we need to run the Machine Learning Model
       * [See our work here!](https://github.com/Sebjet24/Rural_Surge/blob/main/Resources/queries)


- Description of preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including their decision-making process

  * Rural and urban % per KS county
  * Number of ISP options per KS county
  * Highest internet speed per KS county

- Description of how data was split into training and testing sets

  * TBD

- Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
  
  * The team discussed the different machine learning options, and initially thought that a **Decision Tree** would be a good fit for our project.

- After learning more about the data, we decided that an **Unsupervised Learning** model would be a better fit. 

  * Using the K-means clustering algorithm, we could demonstrate how population density in each Kansas county correlated with internet speed, as well as number of Internet Service Providers
